1. Random generator skeleton

2.  Print random nos in a particular range 
  
1. Write a program that simulates a coin flip. Run it many times—do the results look random to you?

2. Write a program that picks a number between 1 and 100, and then lets the user guess what the
number is. The program should tell the user if their guess is too high, too low, or just right.

3. Write a program that solves the guessing game from part 1. How many guesses does your program
need?

4. Make a "slot machine" game that randomly displays the results of a slot machine to a player—have 3
(or more) possible values for each wheel of the slot machine. Don't worry about displaying the text
"spinning" by. Just choose the results and display them and print out the winnings (choose your own
winning combinations).
